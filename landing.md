		<p>The 1970s is undoubtedly one of the most iconically stylish decades of all time. But even the flares and bell bottoms, prints and unabashed color pairings, and the louder styles of the time shy in the face of Parisian elegance. Despite the lack of denim, cropped shorts and tops, and other especially Western 70s styles seen in Paris, the French maintained their fashion relevance and influence at the time with nearly the complete opposite approach.</p>

					<h3>Wide-brim Hats</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Somewhere between the fedora and a cowboy hat—with a wide brim, structured shape and '70s vibe—is the hat to have even right now. Get inspired by the icons who wore it well first and see who's rocking the millinery in a truly modern way.</p>

					<h3>Capes and Dark Silhouettes</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The empire waist silhouette was popular in the '70s and remains popular. The empire waist is high, usually right under the bust, and the dress or blouse flows out from there. Empire waist pieces were popular with the flower child or hippie movement of the 1970s, representing a relaxed and carefree lifestyle.</p>

					<h3>High Boots and Midi Skirts</h3>
				</header>
				<p>"Women Call it Sleazy, Dowdy, Depressing; but Designers Say It Will Catch On Yet." Indeed, the New Yorker warned that “no amount of protest will stem the tide of the longer skirt”—the fashion industry had too much invested in it. Shoppers looking for miniskirts found racks stuffed with midis, with a few maxis, pantsuits, and gaucho pants (whose full, calf-length silhouette mimicked the midi) thrown in for variety. Bonwit Teller even banned its saleswomen from wearing minis on the shop floor.</p>
