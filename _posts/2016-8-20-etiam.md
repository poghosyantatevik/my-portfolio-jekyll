ollars are classic; they've been around for a long, long time. The first iteration of the collar, known as a ruff, originated in the mid-16th century. Originally, the removable pleated style was worn by both men and women in Europe, and were intended for functionality. Today, the silhouette is purely stylistic, and currently, it's poised for a revival. The statement collar trend is picking up in popularity among designers â€” and on Instagram.
The latest resurgence first popped up on the runways in 2019 at Simone Rocha and Self-Portrait, and continued to rise in popularity throughout the Fall/Winter 2020 seasons. Last month in Milan, Gucci showed just how cool the trend be. Creative director Alessandro Michele styled a ruffled bib collar top underneath a boxy jacket and tiered maxi skirt.
According to Paolini, the New York-based label's Ziggy collars have been worn over tees, dresses, and coats. But if you're looking for additional creative ways to wear a statement collar, keep scrolling below.
