If the idea of cut-out fashion conjures up images of cheap and revealing bodycon dresses worn by teenagers and reality stars, you are not alone. Over the past few years, as fashionâ€™s love of the cut-out trickled down to the high street, the trend slowly lost its cool, but high-end designers are now bringing it back in a big way.

On the spring/summer 2020 catwalks this past September, a number of major designers backed the cut-out comeback, mostly for eveningwear, but there was also a dabble in making it work for the office. Meanwhile, the autumn/winter 2020 London and New York shows have seen the cut-out emerge as one of the most obvious trends for next season, seen on everything from slinky dresses to chunky knits.

How exactly has this flesh-flashing feature become chic again? Well, the answer is in the way designers have pulled it back.

On the SS20 Versace catwalk, Gigi Hadid made an entrance in a black dress that draped across her body, revealing just the top of her abs through a slit in the material, which was pulled together with a trademark Versace gold clasp. At Saint Laurent, Christopher Kane and Alexander McQueen too, black eveningwear got the cut-out treatment in the form of slits, gaps and unexpected necklines.
