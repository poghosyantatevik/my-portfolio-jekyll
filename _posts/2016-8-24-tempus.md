Bralettes paired with all sorts of outerwear – from blazers and coats to bomber jackets – also popped up at the Fall/Winter 2020 shows of brands like Dolce and Gabbana, Marc Jacobs, Off-White, and Saint Laurent. At Jacquemus, models matched slip dresses with incredibly low-cut necklines showing off a matching bra. Virginie Viard paired embellished bras with tweed jackets and long cardigans at Chanel’s Resort 2021 show, while at Alberta Ferretti’s Resort 2021 show, a fringed jacket was teamed with a bralette.
