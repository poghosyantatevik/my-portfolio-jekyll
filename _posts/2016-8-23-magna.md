Fashion trends come and go, but denim jeans are one item of clothing that will always be a staple in many closets. 
It's the particular style of denim that changes year after year, some decades seeing a rise in baggy jeans, others full of tight, low-rise moments. 
Here is a glimpse at what jeans looked like the year you were born. 
Back in the mid-1800s, when jeans were first invented, they were mainly popular with miners and workers who needed to wear something sturdy and reliable. 
It took a few more decades before jeans became a casual staple worn by all genders on a regular basis.
It wasn't until the 1930s that jeans became more mainstream when they entered the Hollywood scene in popular Westerns.
Back then, jeans were associated with cowboys and the movie stars who played them. 
Later, in the very early 1950s, jeans were just starting to become more of a fashion trend thanks to actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean wearing them on a pretty regular basis.
Still, even as they became more "cool," they had a Western vibe to them and were primarily worn by men.
It wasn't until 1952 when Marilyn Monroe wore a pair in her film "River of No Return" that they became a staple for women as well.
