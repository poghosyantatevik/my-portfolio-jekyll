For women, the Hippie look of the 1960s carried over to the early ’70s. Popular styles included bell bottom pants, frayed jeans, midi skirts, maxi dresses, Tie dye, peasant blouses, and ponchos. Some accessories that will help pull together your early ’70s Hippie outfits are chokers, headbands, scarves, and jewelry made of wood, stones, feathers, and beads.

Women in the early ’70s who didn’t go for the Hippie look often chose more of a dressy or dressy casual wardrobe. This look included tight t-shirts or dresses with a fitted wide lapel blazer, flared pants, sweaters, cardigans, and boots. Pastels were popular colors, especially baby blue, yellow, mauve, and peach.

Men’s early 1970s fashion was largely influenced by bright colors and textures. Satin shirts, sometimes with ruffles or lace, were often pared with hip-hugging bell bottoms. Bright colored three piece and double breasted suits in corduroy, paisley, wool, and crushed velvet were popular for special and even every day occasions. More casual looks for men included bell bottom jeans, Tie dye, flannel shirts, pleated pants, and sweaters with oxford shoes, platforms, flips flops, or boots.
